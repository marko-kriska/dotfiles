{"videoId":"fQYqjh_Kkrs","title":"Deciphering the Gospels Proves Jesus Never Existed - R.G. Price","author":"History Valley","authorId":"UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng","published":1670022000000,"description":"https://www.amazon.com/Deciphering-Gospels-Proves-Jesus-Existed/dp/1483487830\n\nThe idea that Jesus may never have existed has been around in modern scholarship for over a century, but it has never been sufficiently proven. In this book, R. G. Price presents new research to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Jesus of the Gospels never existed. Intertextual analysis shows that the Gospel of Mark is a fictional allegory written in reaction to the First Jewish-Roman War. Like other recent scholars, Price shows that the scenes of Mark are constructed from Old Testament scriptures and that the character and teachings of Jesus are based on the writings of Paul the apostle. Using intertextual analysis, Price shows that every biography of Jesus is derived from the Gospel of Mark and explores the implications of this finding. Price compellingly demonstrates that prior to the writing of the Gospels Jesus was understood as a heavenly being and that it was the Gospel stories, all derived from the fictional story of Mark, that led to the belief that Jesus was a real person.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng/join\n\nTwitter: @Jacob56723278\nEmail: jacobberman553@gmail.com\nhttps://www.patreon.com/HistoryValley?fan_landing=true\nDiscord server https://discord.gg/9ns2vHRHhh\nPayPal Link https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JacobBerman22?locale.x=en_US\nCenturions For Paul Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/957292477950756","viewCount":7875,"lengthSeconds":3609,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1671496286193,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"AiNqNVyC71NkXgiu"}

{"videoId":"8oL62MazAPM","title":"The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems - Dr. Robert M. Price 2X PHD","author":"History Valley","authorId":"UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng","published":1671404400000,"description":"https://www.amazon.com/Christ-Myth-Theory-Its-Problems/dp/1578840171\r\n\r\nThe Christ-Myth theory ... \"Worse Than Atheism\"? New Testament scholar Robert M. Price, one of America's leading authorities on the Bible, has assembled in his book evidence that shows that almost the entire \"biography of Jesus\" is a conscious reworking of earlier literature.It is one thing to say \"There are no gods\" or \"Jesus was not a god, just a man.\" It is quite another thing to say \"Jesus of Nazareth never existed at all\" or that \"Christ is a myth.\" But scholars have been saying exactly that since at least 1793 when the Enlightenment scholar Charles Dupuis began to publish his 13-volume Origine de Tous les Cultes, ou Religion Universelle, which elucidated the astral origins not only of Christianity but of other ancient religions as well. New Testament scholar Robert M. Price, one of America's leading authorities on the Bible, here summarizes much of the scholarship that has led him and a growing number of modern scholars to conclude that Christ -- a partial synonym for Jesus of Nazareth -- is mythical. Most usefully, Price has assembled evidence that shows that almost the entire \"biography of Jesus\" has been created from Greek Old Testament stories and themes and even incorporates motifs from Homer, Euripides, and perhaps Aesop. Because readers will have a hard time \"taking it on faith\" that the Jesus biography is merely a reworking of previous material, broad swaths of \"Old Testament\" context are quoted in association with each New Testament equivalent, so readers can judge for themselves whether or not Dr. Price's claim be true: the \"Live of Christ\" was not fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies; it was, rather, a conscious reworking of earlier literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng/join\r\n\r\nTwitter: @Jacob56723278\r\nEmail: jacobberman553@gmail.com\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/HistoryValley?fan_landing=true\r\nDiscord server https://discord.gg/3yPS8ruux4\r\nPayPal Link https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JacobBerman22?locale.x=en_US\r\nCenturions For Paul Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/957292477950756\r\nPublic History Valley Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/639724514390191","viewCount":1228,"lengthSeconds":5862,"watchProgress":5838.833225,"timeWatched":1671490187502,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"hfsWiiuBDXCp0CWg"}
