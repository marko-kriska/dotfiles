{"videoId":"fQYqjh_Kkrs","title":"Deciphering the Gospels Proves Jesus Never Existed - R.G. Price","author":"History Valley","authorId":"UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng","published":1670022000000,"description":"https://www.amazon.com/Deciphering-Gospels-Proves-Jesus-Existed/dp/1483487830\n\nThe idea that Jesus may never have existed has been around in modern scholarship for over a century, but it has never been sufficiently proven. In this book, R. G. Price presents new research to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Jesus of the Gospels never existed. Intertextual analysis shows that the Gospel of Mark is a fictional allegory written in reaction to the First Jewish-Roman War. Like other recent scholars, Price shows that the scenes of Mark are constructed from Old Testament scriptures and that the character and teachings of Jesus are based on the writings of Paul the apostle. Using intertextual analysis, Price shows that every biography of Jesus is derived from the Gospel of Mark and explores the implications of this finding. Price compellingly demonstrates that prior to the writing of the Gospels Jesus was understood as a heavenly being and that it was the Gospel stories, all derived from the fictional story of Mark, that led to the belief that Jesus was a real person.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng/join\n\nTwitter: @Jacob56723278\nEmail: jacobberman553@gmail.com\nhttps://www.patreon.com/HistoryValley?fan_landing=true\nDiscord server https://discord.gg/9ns2vHRHhh\nPayPal Link https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JacobBerman22?locale.x=en_US\nCenturions For Paul Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/957292477950756","viewCount":7875,"lengthSeconds":3609,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1671496286193,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"AiNqNVyC71NkXgiu"}

{"videoId":"XVYlxHteUMs","title":"Zeitgeist - The Movie | Documentary | Sociological | History | Christianity","author":"Moconomy","authorId":"UCoOHTipX1_cNiC9seIPfUXA","published":1670626800000,"description":"Documentation on Sociology: Zeitgeist - The Movie - Mythology and belief in society today, presenting uncommon perspectives of common cultural issues.\n\nZeitgeist - The Movie (2007)\nDirector: Peter Joseph\nWriters: Peter Joseph\nStars: Chogyam Trungpa, Jordan Maxwell, George Carlin\nGenre: Documentary, History\nCountry: United States\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 1 June 2007 (USA)\nDuration: 115 min\n\nStoryline:\nThis film gathers information from many sources and puts it together in a way that shows it is possible for people to be manipulated by large institutions, governments and economic powers. It is divided into 3 parts. \n1. Religion: Pagan astrological beliefs compared to modern and ancient religions. \n2. 9/11: An overview of the numerous questionable aspects of this immensely important event. \n3. The Federal Reserve Bank: A history of its formation and ability to control the economy. With many news clips from tragic events in history, audio excerpts from those who believe people are being misled about the level of freedom they have.\n\nReviews:\n\"Some films seek to entertain. \"Zeitgeist\" seeks to inform. This sociological documentary contains a wealth of facts. And these facts function to support its overall message; namely, that powerful, societal institutions, through action and speech, control individuals in unimagined ways. For what purpose? Power. The film singles out religious institutions, government institutions, and financial institutions.\n\nThe film's first segment, 28-minutes in duration, is unparalleled in its succinct yet potent discussion of religion, and its relation to history and current culture. Splendid narration, background music, and visuals make this segment spellbinding. But more importantly, the message is factual and nothing short of profound.\n\nThe segments on government and financial institutions are scarcely less significant. The focus is on the 9/11 tragedy at the World Trade Center. Viewers who adhere to the official line will no doubt protest. But they cannot alter the facts that point to a conspiracy of powerful institutional leaders. The banking/financial segment follows suit with a similarly scathing critique.\n\n\"Zeitgeist\" hammers television. From the film \"Network\" (1976), the character Howard Beale shouts the evils of the \"boob-tube\"; \"Television is not the truth; television is an ... amusement park\"; its output is designed to keep you in a distracted, naive bubble.\n\nThe film is not perfect. Discussion of 9/11 will eventually make the film dated. The first four-minute segment is sleep inducing. A few spots of filler could have been replaced with further critiques of the media. And most importantly, what the film calls \"lies\" (as a noun) in some instances could be replaced with the word \"ignorance\". Yet, whether the evil is ignorance or lies, the end result is the same.\n\nOrdinarily, these imperfections would reduce my rating from a perfect score of ten. But the overall message of \"Zeitgeist\" is so profound and the presented facts so stunning that I cannot justify a score less than the highest possible.\" -Written by Lechuguilla on IMDb.com\n\nAlso Known As (AKA):\n(original title) Zeitgeist\nJapan (Japanese title) ツァイトガイスト\nPoland Duch epoki\nRussia Дух времени\nSpain Zeitgeist\nUK Zeitgeist: The Movie\nUSA (promotional title) Zeitgeist: The Movie\nUSA Zeitgeist\n\nMORE DOCS!\n► Gold: https://bit.ly/2IRZ0OA\n► World Economy: https://bit.ly/36QlhEM\n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/3lOiCll\n\n#finance #documentaries #economy\n\nCOPYRIGHT / IMPORTANT: All Rights Reserved!

Price 2X PHD","author":"History Valley","authorId":"UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng","published":1671404400000,"description":"https://www.amazon.com/Christ-Myth-Theory-Its-Problems/dp/1578840171\r\n\r\nThe Christ-Myth theory ... \"Worse Than Atheism\"? New Testament scholar Robert M. Price, one of America's leading authorities on the Bible, has assembled in his book evidence that shows that almost the entire \"biography of Jesus\" is a conscious reworking of earlier literature.It is one thing to say \"There are no gods\" or \"Jesus was not a god, just a man.\" It is quite another thing to say \"Jesus of Nazareth never existed at all\" or that \"Christ is a myth.\" But scholars have been saying exactly that since at least 1793 when the Enlightenment scholar Charles Dupuis began to publish his 13-volume Origine de Tous les Cultes, ou Religion Universelle, which elucidated the astral origins not only of Christianity but of other ancient religions as well. New Testament scholar Robert M. Price, one of America's leading authorities on the Bible, here summarizes much of the scholarship that has led him and a growing number of modern scholars to conclude that Christ -- a partial synonym for Jesus of Nazareth -- is mythical. Most usefully, Price has assembled evidence that shows that almost the entire \"biography of Jesus\" has been created from Greek Old Testament stories and themes and even incorporates motifs from Homer, Euripides, and perhaps Aesop. Because readers will have a hard time \"taking it on faith\" that the Jesus biography is merely a reworking of previous material, broad swaths of \"Old Testament\" context are quoted in association with each New Testament equivalent, so readers can judge for themselves whether or not Dr. Price's claim be true: the \"Live of Christ\" was not fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies; it was, rather, a conscious reworking of earlier literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yzcsaYuPJfPymf2arGCng/join\r\n\r\nTwitter: @Jacob56723278\r\nEmail: jacobberman553@gmail.com\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/HistoryValley?fan_landing=true\r\nDiscord server https://discord.gg/3yPS8ruux4\r\nPayPal Link https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/JacobBerman22?locale.x=en_US\r\nCenturions For Paul Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/957292477950756\r\nPublic History Valley Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/639724514390191","viewCount":1228,"lengthSeconds":5862,"watchProgress":5838.833225,"timeWatched":1671490187502,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"hfsWiiuBDXCp0CWg"}

Two scholars Mauro Biglino and Paul Wallis argue for a radically different interpretation ...\n——\nPer centinaia e migliaia di anni le persone di tutto il mondo si sono rivolte alla Bibbia per avere informazioni su Dio.  Due studiosi, Mauro Biglino e Paul Wallis, sostengono un'interpretazione radicalmente diversa.\n🇮🇹 Sottotitoli in italiano\n——\nThis video was produced in collaboration with:\n🔵The 5th Kind YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/the5thkind\n🔵Paul Wallis YouTube Channel  https://www.youtube.com/paulwallis \n🔵Mauro Biglino YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MauroBiglinoOfficialChannel\n🔵Paul's Website & Books:  https://www.paulanthonywallis.com/\n🔵Mauro's Website & Books: https://maurobiglino.com/ \n\n\nSeeking out the root meanings of keywords in these ancient texts they find another, quite different story emerges ' one with enormous implications for our understanding of the human race and our place in the universe..\n\nFor more than two millennia readers have interpreted the ancient texts of the Bible as stories of God, a seamless narrative in which God creates the heavens and the earth, botanical and animal life and eventually the human race. However, a number of anomalies in the texts along with intriguing questions of translation point to another possibility.\n\nPaul Wallis is an internationally Bestselling author, researcher and scholar of ancient mythologies. Over the last decade Paul's work has probed the world's mythologies and ancestral narratives for the insights they hold on our origins as a species and our potential as human beings.\n As a senior churchman, Paul served as a Church Doctor, a Theological Educator, and an Archdeacon in the Anglican Church in Australia. He has published numerous titles on Christian mysticism and spirituality.  He is a popular speaker at summits and conferences around the world.\nPaul's work in church ministry has included training pastors in the interpretation of Biblical texts. His work in Biblical translation and interpretation has revealed a forgotten layer of ancient story, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of human origins and our place in the cosmos.\n\nMauro Biglino is an internationally Bestselling Italian author, researcher, and highly regarded scholar of ancient Hebrew. For many years he worked for Rome’s Saint Paul Press as a Bible translator, providing with great precision the literal meaning of Hebrew words for Vatican-approved interlinear Bibles. \n\nIt is an exacting discipline. The scholar must be rigorous in avoiding any kind of interpretation of the word and give only the literal etymological meaning of each word part. \n\nMauro’s findings set him at odds with the conventional expectations of the Catholic world and propelled him onto the international stage where his work has opened up a world of cultural memory recorded in the Bible, yet hidden from the public for centuries by mistaken translation and the dogmas of the Church.\n\nTogether, Mauro and Paul show that the root meanings of a series of key words in the Bible reveal an earlier layer of information very different to the story of God associated with the Bible. Hidden plain sight in the pages of Genesis is an even more ancient narrative, one which reframes the whole story of human beginnings…\n\nThe oldest word in the Bible rendered as “God” is the Hebrew word “elohim.” But is that what the word means? And what are the implications of the translation choices surrounding this mysterious word?\n\nThe final edit of the old testament of the bible, the hebrew canon included the layering of some beautiful and profound theology over the top of ancient texts.  Unfortunately mistranslating traumatic ancestral memories as if they were encounters with god is a choice with far-reaching consequences.  \n\nBelief in a violent xenophobic hierarchical god has been used through the ages to justify violence wars and all manner of abuses.  however, the fidelity with which the ancient manuscripts have been curated in the hebrew canon by countless generations of priests and scribes means that in our generation we can now return to these fascinating artifacts of our pre-history and ask how differently they might be translated..\n🔵Narration by Jazz Walker https://www.fiverr.com/jazzwalker\n🔵Video footage licenced by Envato Elements https://elements.envato.com/ & Storyblocks https://www.storyblocks.com/\n🔵Music Licenced by Envato Elements https://elements.envato.com/ & Epidemic Sound https://www.epidemicsound.com/","viewCount":82430,"lengthSeconds":2260,"watchProgress":697.381227,"timeWatched":1675630221582,"isLive":false,"paid":false,"type":"video","_id":"lDvbUGilm9Qqz8n2"}

I svce su manje bili tek krugovi, a sve više složeni piktogrami. Koja je svrha tih slika i obrazaca, tko im je autor, kakvo značenje skrivaju?\n\nUsprkos svim raspravama, pa i onima koja im nisu davala pravo postojanja, piktogrami u usjevima i dalje se iznenadno i brzo pojavlju svakog proljeća na određenim mjestima na svijetu. Složenost i ljepota tih velikih geometrijski oblkovanih slika se povećava, ali ne i naše razumijevanje njih.
